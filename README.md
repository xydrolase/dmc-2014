========

This repository hosts some of the code snippets we (_Iowa State University Team 1_) 
used for the Data Mining Cup 2014, sponsored by Prudsys AG.

Files in this repository are only part of the overall effort for the 6-week long data mining competition.
The R and Python files concern the generation of the feature matrix. 

This repository does __NOT__ include files for feature-matrix post-processing, and the code for running
various methods (SVM, Random forest, Adaboost etc.), cross-validation etc, mainly because I am mainly
responsible for generating the feature matrix in the team.
